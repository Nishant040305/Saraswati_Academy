    review: `I am glad I chose Saraswati Hindi Jagat for my daughter's PSLE preparation. The teachers are incredibly accommodating, both with scheduling and last-minute requests. My daughter genuinely enjoyed learning from her teacher, Deepanka, whose engaging teaching style helped spark her interest in Hindi. Despite the preparation being quite last-minute, it was highly effective, and my daughter improved significantly, jumping from AL5 to AL2 in her PSLE. I plan to continue with Saraswati Hindi Jagat for her secondary education and highly recommend their services.`,

    review: `Saraswati Hindi Jagat stands out from all the other Hindi tuitions/centers available for students opting for Hindi as a mother tongue in Singapore due to: 1) Passionate and dedicated teachers. I had a very good experience with teachers Priyanka, Renuka, and Swasti. 2) A wide variety of resources used. Highly recommend and keep up the good work! üëç`,

    review: `Definitely recommend Saraswati Hindi Jagat. Hats off to Priyanka Ma‚Äôam who is working really hard to ensure kids get all the study materials on a daily/weekly basis. Teachers are well-trained. My daughter was with teacher Kumkum Jain. She's such a wonderful teacher who taught my child with full dedication and was always ready to help. She is very polite and humble, with immense patience with kids. My daughter has benefited a lot from their Hindi classes and is very happy with the teacher. She has gained immense confidence. They also provide lists of idioms, quotations, intros, and conclusions for each composition, which are so useful. Thanks to both Priyanka Ma‚Äôam and Kumkum Jain Ma‚Äôam for making my daughter‚Äôs PSLE Hindi journey less stressful, easier, and beneficial. ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè`,
